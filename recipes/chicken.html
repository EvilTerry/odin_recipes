        <h1>Mongolian Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../img/chicken.jpeg" alt="chicken">
        <p>If Mongolian beef is your go to when it comes to Chinese take-out, I challenge you to try this version made with chicken instead. The chicken is melt-in-your-mouth tender and requires no marinating time as beef would. Serve over rice.</p>
